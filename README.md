**Board Representation** - bitboards

**Move Search** - minimax, alphabeta pruning, quiescence search, transposition tables, and iterative deepening

**Move Evaluation** - scoring based on material and position, with position calculation based on game progress

**UI** - implementations for both browser and terminal, with options for user to choose color and AI thinking time
